This worksheet is focused on **Pillar 9: Conflict Resolution** from the Twelve Pillars of Crystal Clear Leadership.

When reviewing the client’s responses, focus on:
- How they currently respond to conflict in the workplace — avoidance, aggression, or constructive dialogue
- Their willingness and ability to address issues directly and early
- How they structure and navigate difficult conversations
- Their ability to listen well and uncover root causes
- Their follow-through and rebuilding of trust after resolution

Provide feedback that helps them move from tension to transformation. Reinforce what they’re already doing well, and offer practical tools to:
- Initiate conflict conversations with clarity and calm
- Stay emotionally regulated during tension
- Work toward solutions that protect the relationship and the outcome

If they’ve asked a question or shared a case study, respond directly and tactfully. Use a tone that models leadership in conflict — clear, fair, courageous, and grounded.
