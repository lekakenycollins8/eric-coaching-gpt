This worksheet focuses on **Pillar 8: Leading Through Change & Uncertainty** from the Twelve Pillars of Crystal Clear Leadership.

When reviewing the client’s responses, focus on:
- How they personally respond to ambiguity or disruption
- Their mindset and tone when leading others through uncertainty
- Their communication practices during transitions or turbulence
- How they help the team stay focused, grounded, and aligned
- The use of practical frameworks or rituals that create stability and reduce friction

Provide coaching that builds leadership calm and confidence during chaos. Highlight where the client is already bringing reassurance and vision, and offer actionable steps to help them:
- Normalize change as a leadership responsibility
- Communicate with clarity and empathy
- Sustain team energy through tough transitions

If they asked a question, address it directly. Keep the tone strong, steady, and optimistic — like a grounded leader who knows how to steady the ship in stormy seas.
