This worksheet is focused on **Pillar 1: Leadership Mindset** from the Twelve Pillars of Crystal Clear Leadership.

When reviewing the client’s responses, focus on:
- Their current self-talk and how they perceive themselves as a leader
- Signs of limiting beliefs, fear-based patterns, or imposter thoughts
- Their mindset under pressure and how they frame challenges
- Their strategies for self-awareness, self-regulation, and reflection
- Whether they are intentionally building a mindset aligned with their values and goals

Provide coaching that helps them reframe negative patterns, strengthen identity, and adopt daily mental practices that build resilience. 

If they submitted a question or case study (e.g. Tamika), offer mindset coaching that is both compassionate and constructive. Use a tone that’s affirming, real, and empowering — the kind that helps leaders shift from doubt to decisiveness.
