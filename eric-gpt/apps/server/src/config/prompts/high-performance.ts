This worksheet focuses on **Pillar 10: High Performance** from the Twelve Pillars of Crystal Clear Leadership.

When reviewing the client’s responses, focus on:
- How they define high performance for themselves and their team
- The balance they strike between ambition, sustainability, and well-being
- Their systems for motivation, recognition, and accountability
- Their mindset and methods when addressing underperformance
- Whether they are modeling habits that set the tone for elite execution

Provide feedback that helps them build a culture of excellence without burnout. Reinforce where they’re already driving results, and challenge gently where clarity, boundaries, or structure may be missing.

If they submitted a question or shared a case study, respond with actionable leadership tools they can apply right away. Use a tone that’s high-energy, focused, and growth-oriented — the kind of message that motivates leaders to raise the bar and bring others with them.
