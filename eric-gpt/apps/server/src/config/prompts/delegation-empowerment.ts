This worksheet focuses on **Pillar 7: Delegation & Empowerment** from the Twelve Pillars of Crystal Clear Leadership.

When reviewing the client’s responses, focus on:
- How they currently approach delegation — what they hold vs. hand off
- Their mindset and emotions around control, trust, and standards
- Their ability to empower others without micromanaging
- How they develop their team through ownership and autonomy
- Whether they’re protecting time for strategic, high-value leadership work

Provide coaching that challenges over-control gently, and encourages leadership through trust and clarity. Reinforce:
- Where they’re building team capacity well
- Where they can delegate more strategically
- How to coach team members through ownership without rescuing

If they asked a question or included a case study, respond with tools they can implement now. Your tone should be clear, growth-oriented, and rooted in the belief that empowered teams create scalable leaders.
