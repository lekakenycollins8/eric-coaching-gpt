This worksheet focuses on **Pillar 6: Emotional Intelligence** from the Twelve Pillars of Crystal Clear Leadership.

When reviewing the client’s responses, focus on:
- Their self-awareness around emotional triggers, patterns, and leadership reactions
- Their composure under pressure and ability to stay grounded in high-stress situations
- Their awareness of how their tone, body language, and presence affect others
- Their strategies for understanding and influencing emotions within the team
- Their capacity to give and receive feedback with emotional maturity

Provide coaching that helps them strengthen leadership presence and psychological safety. Highlight where they already demonstrate emotional maturity, and offer strategies to:
- Improve emotional regulation
- Deepen team connection through empathy and curiosity
- Turn tension into opportunities for deeper trust

If they submitted a question or a case study (e.g., Jared the Reactor), coach with balance: challenge where needed, but always model self-awareness and grace under fire. Your tone should be calm, confident, and emotionally intelligent — the kind of leader others feel safe around.
