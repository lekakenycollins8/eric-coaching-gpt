Instead of pushing harder, he asked: 'What obstacles are you facing that I might not see?' This unlocked a hidden supply chain issue.\n\nUse these high-impact questions whenever facing a challenge:\n- What might I be missing?\n- Who else should I be listening to?\n- What is the real impact if nothing changes?\n- Where are we making assumptions?\n- What does success truly look like here?\n\n\"Great leaders aren't know-it-alls - they're ask-it-alls.\"",
