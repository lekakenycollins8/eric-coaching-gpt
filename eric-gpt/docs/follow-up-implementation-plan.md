# Follow-up Worksheet Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the follow-up system in the Eric GPT Coaching Platform. The follow-up system is designed to provide users with ongoing support and guidance after completing their initial workbook, helping them apply what they've learned and continue their leadership development journey.

The follow-up system maintains interactivity with users by asking targeted questions based on their previous worksheet and workbook submissions. This helps determine if users are benefiting from the application and identifies areas where they might need additional support. Follow-up worksheets are strictly targeted at users who have already interacted with the workbook and completed worksheets.

- ‚úÖ Added proper type definitions and error handling for robust operation

### 2. üß† AI Context Enhancement
- ‚úÖ When a follow-up worksheet is submitted, the system retrieves the original submission:
  - ‚è≥ **Correction Needed:** We need to distinguish between pillar follow-ups and workbook follow-ups
  - ‚è≥ **Correction Needed:** We need specialized prompts for each follow-up type
  - ‚è≥ **Correction Needed:** For pillar follow-ups, we need to load the specific pillar submission
  - ‚è≥ **Correction Needed:** For workbook follow-ups, we need to load the original workbook submission
  - ‚è≥ Include the enhanced AI diagnosis in the email notification to the coaching team

### 3. üß© Data Storage & Retrieval
- ‚úÖ Updated server-side logic to:
  - ‚úÖ Store both original and follow-up submissions with proper linkage

- ‚è≥ **Correction Needed:** Current worksheet type detection doesn't properly distinguish between pillar and workbook follow-ups
- ‚è≥ **Correction Needed:** Need to enhance `followupUtils.ts` with specialized functions:
  - ‚è≥ Add `getFollowupType(followupId)` to determine if it's a pillar or workbook follow-up
  - ‚è≥ Create `loadFollowupContext(originalSubmission, followupType, pillarId?)` to load appropriate context

### 4. üì¨ Email Notification to Eric
- ‚úÖ On follow-up worksheet submission:
  - ‚úÖ Compose and send a notification email to `help@jackiercoaching.com` (implemented in `emailService.ts`)
  - ‚úÖ Email includes basic information:
    - ‚úÖ User ID and name
    - ‚úÖ Worksheet ID (e.g., `pillar6-followup`)
    - ‚úÖ Summary of ratings and reflection response
    - ‚úÖ Flag if user requested human help or submitted a low score
  - ‚è≥ **Correction Needed:** Email content should be specialized based on follow-up type:
    - ‚è≥ For pillar follow-ups: Include pillar-specific progress analysis
    - ‚è≥ For workbook follow-ups: Include implementation progress analysis
  - ‚è≥ **Correction Needed:** Enhanced AI diagnosis in email should match the follow-up type
