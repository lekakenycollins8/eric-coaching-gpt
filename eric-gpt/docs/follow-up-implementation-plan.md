# Follow-up Worksheet Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the follow-up system in the Eric GPT Coaching Platform. The follow-up system is designed to provide users with ongoing support and guidance after completing their initial workbook, helping them apply what they've learned and continue their leadership development journey.

The follow-up system maintains interactivity with users by asking targeted questions based on their previous worksheet and workbook submissions. This helps determine if users are benefiting from the application and identifies areas where they might need additional support. Follow-up worksheets are strictly targeted at users who have already interacted with the workbook and completed worksheets.

## Core Features

1. **Interactive Workbook**
   - Multi-section interface with progress indicators
   - Auto-save and "Save & Continue Later" capability
   - Form validation and "Submit" action

2. **AI Diagnosis Engine**
   - GPT-4–powered analysis of workbook responses
   - Identification of top leadership pillars
   - Automated recommendation of next worksheets
   - Personalized analysis of follow-up submissions with context from previous submissions

3. **Human Coach Handoff**
   - Instant email alerts to coaching email upon client submission
   - Emails containing detailed results from both initial and follow-up submissions
   - Coaching integration for collaborative client support

4. **Follow-Up System**
   - Two types of follow-up worksheets stored in JSON files:
     - `crystal-clear-leadership-followup.json`: Pillar-specific follow-ups
     - `implementation-support-followup.json`: Implementation method follow-ups
   - Scheduled follow-up assessments sent automatically
   - Tailored worksheets delivered based on client progress
   - User feedback sent to AI for personalized analysis and diagnosis

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented the core functionality of the platform:
